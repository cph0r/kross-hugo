Hello! I’m Saloni, a passionate UI/UX designer with a keen eye for creating visually appealing digital experiences. I embarked on my design journey at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Jodhpur, where I earned my Bachelor’s in Design (B.Des). My specialization lies in Accessory Design, a field that allows me to blend creativity with functionality. Navigating the realms of design at NIFT has not only equipped me with a robust foundation but has also instilled in me the importance of innovation and user-centric design principles. 

With a background rooted in the world of accessories, I bring a unique perspective to UI/UX design, combining the precision of accessory design with the aesthetics and usability crucial for an engaging user experience. As a designer, I thrive on transforming ideas into visually compelling and user-friendly interfaces.

I believe in the power of design to enhance the way users interact with digital platforms, and I am dedicated to crafting solutions that seamlessly merge form and function. Let’s create designs that not only catch the eye but also elevate the user experience to new heights!
