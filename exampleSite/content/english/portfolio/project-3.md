#### Project Details

<b>Inspiration: Vintage (1980-94)<b>

Often remembered for its materialism and consumerism, the decade also saw the rise of the "yuppie," an explosion of blockbuster movies, and the emergence of cable networks like MTV, which introduced the music video and launched the careers of many iconic artists. The decade saw major socioeconomic change due to advances in technology and a worldwide move away from planned economies and towards laissez-faire capitalism.
