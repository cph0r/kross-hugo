#### Project Details

Product lifestyle photos are a popular marketing tool for businesses to showcase their products in a real-life context, such as showing a model using the product or placing it in a setting where it would be used. These types of images can help to create a more emotional connection between the customer and the product, which can lead to higher sales conversions.
